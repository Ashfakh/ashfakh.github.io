25. Majored in Electrical engineering from IIT Madras. Now working as a Software Engineer for India's largest fantasy sports platform, but I still holds a flame for everything Art related. An Ardent lover of Science, History, Books and Music. Loves to talk about anything between Irodov to Kafka. Constantly on the lookout for answers to the big questions in life. Haven’t figured out even a fraction of it, but is optimistic I’ll get there someday.
